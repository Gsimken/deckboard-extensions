# How to add your extensions

- In your repository, create a new release that includes an .asar file for you extension ([example](https://github.com/rivafarabi/deckboard-power-control/releases/tag/v1.0.3))
- Create a pull request which includes a yml file. This yml provided the details of the extension ([example](https://github.com/rivafarabi/deckboard-extensions/blob/master/extensions/power-control.yml))
- Make sure the package name in the yml file and the name of the released asar file are the same.
- If you create a new version, you will also need to create another pull request with the updated yml file that includes new version of the extension
